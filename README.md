# Steam Bot

I made this bot to learn more about NodeJS, npm and its packages. And I found it very easy to understand and to make something I need quite quickly.

## Install

#### Windows Installation
1. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) which contains _npm_ too.

2. Open `install.bat`.

3. Rename `credentials.example.js` to `credentials.js` and insert there your steam credentials and API key from google.

4. Open `start.bat`.

#### Mac Installation
1. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) which contains _npm_ too.

2. Locate the directory and run `npm i`

3. Rename `credentials.example.js` to `credentials.js` and insert there your steam credentials and API key from google.

4. Run `node index.js`
